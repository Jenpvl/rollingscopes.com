  <h1 class="event-title">The Rolling Scopes</h1>

  <p>This is not just another community of developers, this is something more.</p>

  <p>For years we have been organizing meetups and conferences, where you can always learn something new, share
    your knowledge, discover new technologies, meet old and find new friends.</p>

  <p>Web-related technologies stack is so broad that it is impossible to enumerate all the topics that have been
    covered at our events: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, UX, UI, Testing, VR, React ...</p>

  <p>Each time our events take place in a different city, so that makes it hard to say where the next one will
    take place.</p>

  <p> We are happy to collaborate and welcome all kinds of talk proposals. Have any suggestions or feedback? Want
    to give a talk or conduct a workshop?
    Contact us on <a href="mailto:rolling.scopes@gmail.com">rolling.scopes@gmail.com</a></p>
