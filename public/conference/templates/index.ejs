        <h2>What's up front-end folks!</h2>
        <p>
On behalf of Minsk front-end/JavaScript community, <a target="_blank" href="http://rollingscopes.com/">The Rolling Scopes <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i></a> crew is glad to announce the upcoming RSConf2017 front-end conference! <a href="http://2016.conf.rollingscopes.com/">February 2016</a> was too awesome to do it just once :)
</p>
  <p>
    Next winter Minsk will once again become a gathering spot for amazing people of the front-end scene presenting hot topics and sharing their expertise and vision.
Currently the agenda is still work-in-progress, but we can promise you two full days of delicious content: Workshop Saturday and Conference Sunday! We hope to treat you to talks in both standard-length and lightning format so we issue  the Call for Papers at our full lung capacity! Workshops, presentations, lightning talks – we want it all at
<a href="mailto:rolling.scopes@gmail.com">rolling.scopes@gmail.com</a> (primary conference language is English).
<br />
Let’s Roll!

      <h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
      <p>Want to give a talk, but do not have enough material for a full talk? Have a shout-out for an open source project or tool?
        Want to share a community story (everyone loves stories!)? Preach the must-know fundamentals of Web, JavaScript, CSS, etc?
        Then lightning talks are for you! These talks are, at max, 5 minute talks done in quick succession. No need to fill the whole slot, though!

        We are accepting, reviewing, and selecting proposals for lightning talks in advance.
