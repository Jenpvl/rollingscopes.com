      <h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
      <p>Want to give a talk, but do not have enough material for a full talk? Have a shout-out for an open source project or tool?
        Want to share a community story (everyone loves stories!)? Preach the must-know fundamentals of Web, JavaScript, CSS, etc?
        Then lightning talks are for you! These talks are, at max, 5 minute talks done in quick succession. No need to fill the whole slot, though!

        We are accepting, reviewing, and selecting proposals for lightning talks in advance.

        <p>The Saturday before the main conference will be dedicated to a series of workshops.
            Your ticket for the conference does not grant you admission to the workshops.
            Space being limited, please only register if you are sure to attend.

                <!--<p>The web is transforming into a more interactive, more powerful platform every day.</p>-->
<!--<p>Yet we’re rarely using its full potential – for instance by using impressive and powerful 3D visualisations to convey better visual representations.</p>-->
<!--<p>In this workshop I will show a few case studies using WebGL for data visualisation of source code repositories, interactive models of apartments with realistic furniture, traffic visualisation.</p>-->
<!--<p>The workshop will also talk about potential pitfalls and performance bottlenecks and how to overcome them – using Three.js as an example.</p>-->
